This is the repository of my website. I used Next.js (React framework).

## Getting Started

Install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if you don't have and then run.

```bash
nvm use
```

Once you select the correct version of node for this project, you need to install the packages.

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
